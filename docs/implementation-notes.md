# Implementation Notes

This is the running log of **justified deviations** from the design (per `AGENTS.md`): a place to
record a deliberate divergence, with its reason, at the moment it is made.

**The log is currently empty.** As of the v18 design rewrite (`docs/47-claude-design-v18.md`) every
prior entry has been reconciled into the design document — either folded into the body as the settled,
present-tense state of the system, or dropped as superseded / dated validation bookkeeping. The design
document now reflects the system *as built*, including the deviations that used to live here. Examples of
what was folded in during the 2026-07 wave (the latency-recovery pass, the tunable-knobs + native-resync
follow-up, the `docs/45` investigation, and the `docs/46` review-fix pass):

- the **Firecracker warm-restore wiring** (now `snapshot_restore: true`, cured host-side — cached-client
  invalidation across FC's connection-severing snapshot, verbatim baked-vsock-path re-bind under the
  `reject_live_baked_vsock` guard, the `PUT /entropy` device, and the AGENT-2 pre-spawn reaper epoch — with
  the `restore_rotates_host_paths: false` single-lineage constraint and `lazy_restore: false` UFFD gap);
- the **"rotate everything" restore identity refresh** (MAC *and* IP + default route, native in-agent,
  zero-netlink) delivered by a **single native `Resync`/`ResyncAck` round-trip** that replaced three
  subprocess execs;
- the tunable **`KernelVerbosity` / `ConsoleMode` / `Timeouts`** knobs and the shared `build_kernel_cmdline`
  builder, the **event-driven `poll(2)` guest accept loop**, and the **adaptive shutdown-grace poll**;
- the `docs/46` recorded gaps now documented in the body/§16: `Egress::Open` has no arbitrary egress, the
  privileged `host_services_port` is rejected fail-loud, the `mkfs.erofs` fallback is unwired, the proxy CA
  is per-artifacts-dir, the mmdebstrap keyring is the base-image's, `limits_enforced` means "memory
  controller delegated", the snapshot cache key folds the pinned CH identity, and the carried `vhost`
  patch is vendored in-tree.

See design §12 ("Cross-cutting invariants") for the rules and §16 ("Open decisions and known gaps") for
what remains forward work.

**When you make a new deviation,** add a short entry here — *what* you diverged from and *why* — and,
once it stabilizes, fold it into the design document and delete it from this log. Keep this file
small: a growing log means the design doc has drifted from the code.
